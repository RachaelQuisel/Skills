# Execute

Now implement precisely as planned, in full.

## Implementation Requirements

- Write elegant, minimal, modular code
- Adhere strictly to existing code patterns, conventions, and best practices
- Include thorough, clear comments/documentation within the code
- As you implement each step:
  - Update the markdown tracking document with emoji status and overall progress percentage dynamically

## Behavior Rules

- Follow the plan exactly - no extra scope
- Update progress tracking as you complete each task:
  - 🟥 To Do → 🟨 In Progress → 🟩 Done
- Keep code minimal and consistent with existing codebase
- Document as you go
