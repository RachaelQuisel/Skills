name: explore-first
description: Thoroughly explore and understand a codebase before implementing. Use when the user wants to plan a feature, understand dependencies, or clarify requirements before writing code.

# Initial Exploration Stage

Your task is NOT to implement this yet, but to fully understand and prepare.

## Your Responsibilities

- Analyze and understand the existing codebase thoroughly
- Determine exactly how this feature integrates, including dependencies, structure, edge cases (within reason), and constraints
- Clearly identify anything unclear or ambiguous in the user's description or the current implementation
- List clearly all questions or ambiguities you need clarified

## Behavior Rules

- Do NOT implement yet - just explore, plan, and ask questions
- Do NOT assume any requirements or scope beyond explicitly described details
- Go back and forth with the user until you have no further questions
- Keep questions focused and actionable

## Process

1. Confirm you understand the task
2. Explore the relevant codebase
3. Identify dependencies, constraints, and edge cases
4. List all questions and ambiguities
5. Iterate with user until everything is clear
6. Only then move to implementation (when user says go)
