# Document Structure

The discovery brief follows a 10-section structure. Each section has a specific purpose and format.

---

## Section 1: Title Page

**Purpose:** Set context and expectations immediately.

**Elements:**
- "BUSINESS CASE" (large, bold, centered)
- "WITH EXPECTED BENEFITS" (subtitle)
- Disclaimer in italics (critical — sets expectations)
- Project title (e.g., "Centralized Data Architecture & System Integration")
- "for {Client Name}"
- "Prepared by" + XRAY logo/name
- Date (Month Year)

**Disclaimer Template:**
> *Disclaimer: This Business Case is based on limited information from an initial discovery conversation. All assumptions, estimates, and projected benefits are directional and may require refinement after deeper discovery. Please treat this as a preliminary discussion document, not a guarantee of outcomes.*

---

## Section 2: Executive Summary

**Purpose:** Hook the reader with the problem and hint at the solution.

**Length:** 2-3 short paragraphs

**Structure:**
1. Who the client is and what they do
2. The core problem (systems don't talk, manual processes, etc.)
3. What this document proposes (high-level)

**Example:**
> {Client Name} is a {industry} firm serving {customers}. The team currently operates across {number} core platforms—{list platforms}—but these systems don't communicate with each other.
>
> The result: {describe pain — manual handoffs, no visibility, etc.}
>
> This business case outlines a preliminary approach to {solution summary}—giving {Client Name} {key benefits}.

## Section 3: Project Overview

**Purpose:** Quick-reference table for key project details.

**Format:** 2-column table with bold labels

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Client** | {Client Name} |
| **Consultant Team** | XRAY |
| **Project Goal** | {One sentence — what we're trying to achieve} |
| **Estimated Timeline** | [TIMELINE TBD - to be defined after scoping] |
| **Approach** | {Brief description of approach — phased, iterative, etc.} |

---

## Section 4: Current State Analysis

**Purpose:** Document the pain — this justifies the project.

**Subsections:**

### How Work Gets Done Today
- Describe each system/tool and what it's used for
- Note who uses what
- Highlight any positive aspects ("nothing built yet" = clean slate)

### Key Pain Points Identified in Discovery
- Bullet list of specific pain points
- Use language from the transcript
- Be specific (not "inefficient" but "manual handoffs when clients sign up")

### Current Tech Stack
- Simple bullet list of tools mentioned
- Include what each is used for

---

## Section 5: Proposed Solution

**Purpose:** Describe the recommended direction (not detailed architecture).

**Subsections:**

### {Solution Name/Approach}
- One paragraph describing the approach
- Why this approach vs. alternatives

### Why {This Approach}
- Bullet list of reasons
- Address concerns raised in the call if any

### How Data Would Flow
- Describe the key workflows
- Use simple flow descriptions or diagrams
- Include `[ASSUMPTION: ...]` for technical assumptions

---

## Section 6: Expected Benefits

**Purpose:** Translate the solution into value for the client.

**Format:** Subheadings with 1-2 paragraph explanations

**Common benefit categories:**
- Eliminate Manual {X}
- Real-Time Visibility into {Y}
- Foundation for Future Growth
- Easier Troubleshooting/Maintenance
- Scalability

**Note:** Use qualitative descriptions. For quantitative estimates, use ranges and flag as assumptions.

---

## Section 7: Scope of Work

**Purpose:** Outline what would be done (phases, not detailed tasks).

**Format:** Phase headings with bullet lists

### Phase 1: {Name — usually Scoping/Design}
- Bullet list of activities
- Keep high-level

### Phase 2: {Name — usually Build/Implementation}
- Bullet list of activities

### Phase 3: {Name — usually Optimization/Handoff}
- Bullet list of activities

**End with:** `[SCOPE TBD: Specific deliverables and level of effort to be defined after scoping.]`

---

## Section 8: Success Criteria

**Purpose:** Define what "done" looks like.

**Format:** Intro sentence + bullet list

> Based on our conversation, success would look like:

- {Specific outcome 1 — tied to a pain point}
- {Specific outcome 2}
- {Specific outcome 3}
- Both stakeholders can manage day-to-day without constant support

---

## Section 9: Out of Scope

**Purpose:** Set boundaries early to avoid scope creep.

**Format:** Intro sentence + bullet list

> Based on this initial conversation, the following would be out of scope for an initial engagement:

- {Thing they mentioned someone else is doing}
- {Advanced feature they mentioned wanting "later"}
- {Training beyond initial stakeholders}
- Ongoing managed services (available as an add-on)

---

## Section 10: Optional Add-Ons

**Purpose:** Plant seeds for future work.

**Format:** Table

| Add-On | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Ongoing Monthly Support | {Description} |
| {Advanced Feature} | {Description} |
| Team Training | Expand beyond initial stakeholders |
| Additional Integrations | Connect other systems as needs evolve |

---

## Section 11: Next Steps

**Purpose:** Clear call to action.

**Format:** Numbered list with bold prefixes

1. **Review this document** and let us know if we've captured your situation accurately
2. **Share any existing documentation** ({specific docs mentioned in call})
3. **Schedule a scoping call** to dive deeper into requirements

**Optional closing:**
> *We're looking forward to helping {Client Name} {achieve goal}.*
