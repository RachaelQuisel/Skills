# Tone and Style Guide

Writing guidelines for discovery business case documents.

---

## Core Principle

**This is a discovery document, not a final proposal.**

It's based on a single initial conversation. The tone should reflect that: professional, informed, but appropriately tentative about details we don't yet know.

---

## Voice

**Professional and consultative** — we're experts, but we're also listeners.

**Exploratory, not prescriptive** — we're proposing a direction, not dictating a solution.

**Warm but not casual** — XRAY brand is approachable, not stiff.

---

## Framing Language

### Use these phrases:
- "Based on our conversation..."
- "From what we understand..."
- "Based on this initial conversation..."
- "As noted in our conversation..."
- "We'd suggest exploring..."
- "We propose..."
- "This would likely involve..."

### Avoid these phrases:
- "You should..." (too prescriptive)
- "You need to..." (too prescriptive)
- "This will definitely..." (overconfident)
- "We guarantee..." (never guarantee in a discovery doc)
- "Obviously..." (dismissive)

---

## Hedging (When Appropriate)

Use hedging language when discussing:
- Technical assumptions
- Quantitative estimates
- Timeline predictions
- Scope boundaries

**Examples:**
- "could potentially"
- "we'd want to verify"
- "preliminary estimate"
- "would likely"
- "based on similar engagements"

---

## Confidence Calibration

| Situation | Confidence Level | Language |
|-----------|------------------|----------|
| Client stated directly | High | "As you noted..." or "You mentioned that..." |
| Inferred from context | Medium | "Based on our conversation..." |
| Assumption from experience | Low | "[ASSUMPTION: ...]" |
| Unknown | Flag it | "[TBD - to be defined after scoping]" |

---

## Pricing Language

**Never include specific dollar amounts.**

**Always use:**
- `[PRICING TBD]`
- "Pricing will be finalized after scoping is complete"
- "Investment to be determined based on final scope"

**Never use:**
- Specific numbers ($X,XXX)
- Ranges ($X - $Y)
- Hourly rates

---

## Quantification

### When client provided numbers:
> "The team currently spends approximately 50 hours per week on spreadsheet maintenance"

### When estimating:
> "[ASSUMPTION: Based on similar engagements, this typically requires 10-20 hours of setup time]"

### When unknown:
> "Specific time savings would be quantified after deeper discovery"

---

## Using Quotes from Transcript

Quotes add authenticity and show you were listening.

**Good uses:**
- Capturing their self-awareness: *"we haven't had the opportunity to mess anything up yet"*
- Describing desired relationship: *"sprint, relax, recalibrate"*
- Stating goals: *"we really just want to set the foundation"*

**How to incorporate:**
- Use quotation marks for direct quotes
- Attribute clearly: "As you noted..." or "You mentioned..."
- Keep quotes short — excerpts, not paragraphs

---

## Section-Specific Tone

### Executive Summary
- Confident summary of the situation
- Clear problem statement
- Hopeful about the solution

### Current State Analysis
- Factual, observational
- Empathetic to pain points
- Note positives too ("clean slate")

### Proposed Solution
- Confident but not rigid
- Explain reasoning
- Acknowledge assumptions

### Expected Benefits
- Optimistic but grounded
- Connect to stated pain points
- Don't overpromise

### Investment Summary
- Matter-of-fact
- Clear that pricing is TBD
- No apologies for placeholders

### Next Steps
- Action-oriented
- Clear and specific
- Warm closing

---

## Length Guidelines

**This is a discovery document — keep it concise.**

| Section | Target Length |
|---------|---------------|
| Executive Summary | 2-3 paragraphs |
| Current State | 3-4 subsections, brief |
| Proposed Solution | 3 subsections, 1-2 paragraphs each |
| Expected Benefits | 3-5 benefits, 1 paragraph each |
| Scope of Work | 3 phases, bullet lists |
| Investment | Tables only, minimal prose |
| Success Criteria | 5-7 bullet points |
| Out of Scope | 4-6 bullet points |
| Optional Add-Ons | Table, 3-5 rows |
| Next Steps | 3 numbered items |

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- Reference specific tools they mentioned
- Use their company name (not "your company")
- Include verbatim quotes when they add value
- Flag assumptions clearly

### Don't
- Use jargon they didn't use
- Make up numbers
- Promise specific outcomes
- Include filler content
- Over-explain simple concepts
